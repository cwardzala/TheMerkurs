Hey cats and kittens, just wanted to let you all know what the word is on THE
MERKURS!! We just put out a 2-song demo of our new songs... it came out great
and many thanks to Matt Kruger! The songs are on <a href="http://www.purevolume.com/themerkurs">purevolume.com</a> but
the quality is not very great on there. If you would like a demo just let us
know or talk to us at a show and we will give you one... they are free! We appreciate
your constant support and feedback.<br>
